.. important:: F.e.: you have a couple of files with different names and similar part of name: example111.txt, example222.txt and example333.txt. To write a matching rule which will be appropriate for all of the files you can write next expression: example.*.txt and all files will be correspond to your matching pattern. `How to use regular expression you can find here <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression>`_

If needed customer can use not a last template version, for that need click on template version input(7), after that will be open list with all template version, customer can select necessary template version from this list. When fields (6) and (7) filled, fields (9) and (11) will be filled with autogenerated data

2. In field (1) customer can provide rule name or leave default name
3. In field (4) customer should provide name, this name will be part of full name for all converted documents. Full name will be consist name from field (4) + time when this document was converted if document with similar name has been already created. You can customize name using special variables for naming pattern:

- {mailboxUuid} - mailbox UUID which is using integration functionality
- {envelopeUuid} - envelope UUID of the envelope which has been created on platform
- {randomNumber} - random number
- {templateUuid} - template UUID on platform using which envelope has been created
- {date dateFormat} - date of the envelope receiving in format you need (dateFormat can be DDMMYYYY or any of available date formats)
- {"documentId":"fieldName"} - value from the specific document of the template version used in integration rule.

.. important:: **Restrictions of using field value {"documentId":"fieldName"}** - available fields: text, number, currency, date and time, dictionary, lookup, formula, duplicate, autonumber. Fields used in dynamic table can not be used in the naming pattern

.. note:: **Validation of field value in the naming pattern** - field can be optional and in case if field is not filled in empty value will be placed instead of variable. If mandatory field not filled yet until conversion rule should be applied empty value will be placed instead of variable. If naming pattern will contain only optional field or in the moment of file creation no obligatory fields filled in yet we'll place "filename_empty" text instead of variables.
