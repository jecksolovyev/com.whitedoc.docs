Authorization
=============

To work on the platform you have to :ref:`authorize <login>`. To do so you will have to :ref:`register <registration>` a user account (note that there are :ref:`password policies <passwordPolicy>`). If you are planning to work with the platform via API you can use :ref:`application tokens <appToken>`.
