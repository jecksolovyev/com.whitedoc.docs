===============================================
Devices and screen sizes for work with platform
===============================================

**For convenient work with the service, the user must have one of 3 types of supporting devices:**

1. Desktop computer.
2. Tablet.
3. Mobile phone.

At the stage of initialization or / changing the screen resolution, the system checks whether the current screen resolution
of the user is acceptable for further convenient work.

==================
Screen size limits
==================

**1. Desktop**

   minWidth = 1440,

**2. Tablet**

    minWidth = 756,
    maxWidth = 1439

**3. Mobile**

    minWidth = 320,
    maxWidth = 755,

If the user uses a screen resolution that is not suitable for working with the service, he will see a dummy notification
with instructions on what to do next.
