Autonumber field allows you to add a sequence number which will automatically increment on each new envelope created from a template. It does not need to be filled manually. Numbering for each field will never restart, even if field was removed and then added again with same field name. For different field names there will be separate counters. Numbers of deleted draft also will not be reused.

To add autonumber field you should place a cursor in the document and click on Autonumber field button, or drag it over the document.
