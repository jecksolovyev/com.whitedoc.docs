11. Column name - name of a column in a dictionary which will be used for filtering

.. note:: Value from this column will be used to find a matching row in a column selected in dictionary during envelope processing flow.

12. Filter by role mailbox - this attribute specifies if filtering should be applied by role (if enabled) or by field value (if disabled)
13. Field name (changes to role name if previous attribute is enabled) - field which will be used to specify a row by value from column selected in column name (13)

.. note:: If filtering by role is enabled and field becomes role name selector, it selects a role mailbox UUID of which will be used to find a matching row in dictionary. In this case, column with mailbox UUIDs should be selected in column name (13) field for matching.

14. Tooltip - enables adding a custom tooltip that will be displayed for active fields in the envelope. If left blank, the default tooltip is shown
15. Allow custom values - this attribute specifies if field will allow free text input besides selection from predefined values

When all attributes are set, you can click the "Save" button and the field will be added. You can click the field to view or update its properties, and also delete it in the same menu.

Please note that the "Show advanced settings" option is available only while no additional attributes have been added to the field.
Once at least one additional attribute is added — either during creation or later in edit mode — this option will no longer appear, and all available attributes will be displayed for editing instead.
