.. note:: The assistant can only respond strictly within the scope of the documents and the information they contain. If you ask a question that is not relevant to the current envelope, the assistant will respond with the following message:
"I'm sorry, I can only assist with questions directly related to the content of the provided documents. The benefits of becoming a TIA Associate Member are not detailed in these documents."

3. If you have already communicated within the current envelope within the last 24 hours and initiate the assistant again, you will see the history of your conversation. If more than 24 hours have passed, the communication will start from scratch.
